# PRODIGY_WD_01 – Responsive Landing Page

## Overview
PRODIGY_WD_01 is a clean, responsive landing page designed and implemented as part of my first task during the internship at Prodigy Infotech. It's built using modern web technologies and showcases a banner, service sections, contact area, and interactive behavior.

## Features
- Responsive layout that adapts across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Hero/banner sections introducing about us and services
- Contact section with banner image
- Clean structure with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Basic JavaScript interactions (if applicable)

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 – Semantic structure and content markup
- CSS3 – Responsive design using Flexbox/Grid and media queries
- JavaScript – DOM manipulation and event handling

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Abhushan187/PRODIGY_WD_01.git

2. Navigate into the project:cd PRODIGY_WD_01

3. Open the page:

## Customization

- Add more interactivity with JavaScript in `script.js`
